#Tephra

Tephra is a fast, open source JavaScript, Canvas & Audio implementation for Android.

(Think of it as a Browser that can only display a Canvas element)

It is also known as the [Ejecta](http://impactjs.com/ejecta) twin for Android and alot of early work came from Ejecta-X project.

## Documentation

- Getting started (coming soon...)
- Supported APIs & Methods (coming soon...)
